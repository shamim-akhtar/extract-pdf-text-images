Figure 1. Evolution of the tilt angle of the dark and stellar halo from 6 Gyr ago to present day in TNG50 Milky Way analogs
(Pillepich et al. 2023). Each line represents a single halo. The first and second row panels show the evolution of the tilt
angle of the dark matter and stellar halo, and the third row panels show the evolution of the dark halo triaxiality parameter
T≡1−p2/1−q2, where pandqare the major-to-intermediate and major-to-minor axis ratios. We increase the line thickness
with time, and color each line according to its final dark halo tilt angle. On the right panel, we plot the cumulative distribution
function (CDF) of the tilt angles at the present day, which reveals that around half of TNG50 Milky Way analogs have dark
halo tilt angles greater than 10◦. We find a diversity of triaxiality parameters for the tilted halos, ranging from prolate ( T >0.6)
to oblate ( T <0.3).

and stellar disk. Finally, in Section 4, we summarize
the results and discuss their implications in a broader
context.
2.MILKY WAY ANALOGS IN TNG50
In this Section, we describe the sample of galaxies in
TNG50 that we use, and how we define and measure the
tilt angles of galaxies over their formation histories. We
then present the distribution of dark halo tilt angles in
our sample, and relate those measurements to the stellar
halo.2.1. Sample and Methods
TNG50 (Pillepich et al. 2019; Nelson et al. 2019a,b) is
a cosmological magneto-hydrodynamical simulation run
with AREPO (Springel 2010; Weinberger et al. 2020) using
the fiducial TNG galaxy formation model (Weinberger
et al. 2017; Pillepich et al. 2018a) and Planck Collabo-
ration et al. (2016) cosmological parameters. Like the
other simulations in IllustrisTNG (Pillepich et al. 2018b;
Springel et al. 2018; Nelson et al. 2018; Marinacci et al.
2018; Naiman et al. 2018), TNG50 follows the evolution
of cold dark matter (CDM), stars, gas, magnetic fields,
and supermassive black holes from redshift z= 127 to
z= 0. In the case of TNG50, the volume modeled
is 51.7 Mpc3, the mass resolution of the CDM parti-
