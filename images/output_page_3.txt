2.2. Diversity of Tilt Angles
In Figure 1 we show the evolution of the tilt angle
of all 198 Milky Way analogs from 6 Gyr ago to the
present day. Each colored line represents an individual
halo. The top panels show the tilt angle measured for
the dark halo, and the middle panels show that of the
stellar halo. The bottom panels show the dark halo tri-
axiality parameter T≡1−p2/1−q2, where pandq
are the major-to-intermediate and major-to-minor axis
ratios. High values of this parameter ( T >0.6) indicate
prolate halos, while low values ( T <0.3) indicate oblate
halos. For all rows, we show a cumulative distribution
function (CDF) on the right panel that encapsulates the
population trend. For example, 50% of dark halos have
tilt angles greater than 10◦, 25% of dark halos have tilt
angles greater than 20◦, and 15% of dark halos have tilt
angles greater than 40◦. This figure demonstrates that
the majority of halos, for the majority of their lifetimes,
have tilted dark halos. Furthermore, tilted dark halos
show a broad range of shapes ranging from prolate to
oblate.
In Figure 2, we plot the dark halo tilt angle against the
stellar halo tilt angle at each snapshot, for all galaxies
in Figure 1. The relationship is strikingly linear. The
pink region marks the posterior probability of the Milky
Way’s stellar halo tilt angle from Han et al. (2022a),
and the consequent marginal probability distribution of
the dark halo is plotted in the right panel. We overplot
a fitted exponentially modified Gaussian distribution in
blue. From this Figure, we can infer that the tilt of the
dark halo is most likely greather than 20◦for the Milky
Way at the present day.
3.AN ARCHETYPAL GALAXY
In this Section, we present a case-study of a galaxy
with a tilted dark halo and a warped disk. Halo 533060
has a present-day total mass of 8 ×1011M⊙, and it ex-
periences a 10:1 merger ∼7 Gyr ago that induces a
strong misalignment in the dark halo and the disk. This
halo does not undergo any other significant perturba-
tions (e.g., mergers, fly-bys, or massive companions) af-
terwards, allowing us to study the secular evolution of
the tilted dark halo. In the following, we explore the
evolution of the halo tilt angle and the response of the
disk in Halo 533060.
3.1. A Tilted Halo
In Figure 3 we show the evolution of the tilt and shape
of Halo 533060. In the top panel, we plot the tilt angle
of the dark (stellar) halo in blue (red) circles, and in-
dicate points with >5◦statistical uncertainties with x-
marks. The colored shaded regions show a cubic spline

7 Gyr. In the top panel, we plot the tilt angle of the dark
(stellar) halo in blue (red) dots with 1 σerror bars estimated
from jack-knifing. X-marks indicate where the tilt angle un-
certainties are larger than 10◦. The colored shaded lines
are cubic spline interpolations of the data, sampled from
their statistical errors. In the bottom panel, we show the
major-to-intermediate and the major-to-minor ratios of the
dark/stellar halo, which we refer to as the “flattening pa-
rameters.” We grey out the regions in which both flattening
parameters are close to 1 (i.e. roughly spherical), because
the tilt angle is not well defined in this region. Once the
dark (stellar) halo settles into an oblate (triaxial) shape at
∼5 Gyr, the tilt angle steadily decreases from 50◦to 20◦at
present day.

interpolated curve. In the bottom panel, we plot the
major-to-intermediate and the major-to-minor axes ra-
tios for the dark/stellar halo, which refer to as the “flat-
tening parameters.” We grey out the regions in which
both parameters are close to one, indicating that the
halo is roughly spherical and the tilt angle is not well
defined. For Halo 533060, this region corresponds to the
immediate aftermath of the merger. Once the merger
is complete, the debris eventually settles and the dark
(stellar) halo takes on an oblate (triaxial) shape that is
∼50◦misaligned with the disk. Consistent with what
we find in Figure 2, the stellar halo tilt angle closely
follows that of the dark halo. In subsequent isolated
