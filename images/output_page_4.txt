evolution, the dark halo tilt angle declines to 20◦in 5
Gyr, likely due to a combination of processes such as
dynamical friction, phase mixing, and torque exerted
by the disk. Furthermore, we see the dark halo shape
remains roughly constant, indicating that it rotates as a
solid body. This is consistent with previous work (e.g.,
Bailin & Steinmetz 2004; Perryman et al. 2014). At the
present day, the tilt angle of the stellar halo matches
that of the dark halo.
3.2. A Warped Disk
In Figure 4 we show the stellar disk of Halo 533060
at four representative snapshots. We plot stars in a
cylindrical projection, where Ris defined to be posi-
tive (negative) where the azimuthal angle is ±90◦of
the maximum (minimum) vertical height of the disk.
Attlookback = 6 Gyr, there is no discernible azimuthal
asymmtery of the disk. However, shortly after the tilted
halo settles at tlookback = 4 Gyr, we see a warp begin-
ning to develop in the disk. In subsequent snapshots, a
strong warp persists in the disk. We fit the warp as a
power-law in radius and sinusoid in azimuth, plotted in
blue lines.
In Figure 5, we show the time evolution of the am-
plitude of the warp alongside the time evolution of the
tilted dark halo. We define the warp amplitude to be
that of the sinusoid measured at twice the scale radius of
the disk, which grows with time (see, e.g., Frankel et al.
2019, for evidence of such “inside-out” growth in the
Galaxy). The warp amplitude is zero when the halo is
roughly spherical, as shown in the grey shaded region.
Once the dark halo settles into an oblate shape witha 50◦tilt, the warp amplitude sharply increases up to
8 kpc at an approximate rate of 4 kpc /Gyr, then slowly
declines to 4 kpc as the tilt angle decreases.
In a companion study, Han et al. (in prep) use ide-
alized simulations to show that a tilted dark halo can
induce a warp in the galactic disk within a Gyr. Fur-
thermore, there are no massive satellites around Halo
533060 at the time of the onset of the warped disk. All
of these pieces of evidence indicate that the warped disk
of Halo 533060 is driven by its tilted dark halo.
4.SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION
In this Letter, we have analyzed the “tilt angle”—a
misalignment of the inner ( r <50 kpc) dark halo and
the stellar disk—in the Illustris TNG50 simulation. We
find an abundance of Milky Way-like halos that are sig-
nificantly tilted at the present day, and identify an iso-
lated halo that allows us to study the secular evolution
of a merger-induced tilted dark halo. We find that the
tilt angle decreases over time, likely due to dynamical
friction and phase mixing of the merger debris. The
timescale of this decay is long: the tilt angle declines
from 50◦to 20◦over 5 Gyr. Furthermore, the stellar
halo is a good tracer of the underlying dark halo tilt
angle over all epochs. Lastly, we find a compelling re-
lationship between the tilted dark halo and a persistent
warp in the galactic disk. The warp amplitude increases
sharply after the tilt angle reaches its maximum, and
subsequently follows the gradual decline of the tilt an-
gle over ∼4 Gyr.
The shape and configuration of the dark halo is pri-
marily set by gravity, and is affected by baryonic feed-
