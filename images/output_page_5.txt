Figure 5. Correspondence between the warp amplitude and
the dark halo tilt. On the top panel we plot the evolution
of the dark halo tilt as in Fig 3. On the bottom panel we
plot the amplitude of the disk warp measured at twice the
scale radius. We grey out the same region as Fig 3 where the
halo is roughly spherical and the tilt angle is not well defined.
When the halo is spherical, the warp amplitude is zero. Once
the halo settles to an oblate shape and a tilt angle of 50◦,
the warp amplitude sharply increases over 1 Gyr. There are
no satellite galaxies or equivalent perturbers present at this
epoch. In subsequent evolution, the warp amplitude stays
stable over 4 Gyr as the tilt angle of the dark halo slowly
declines.back physics (e.g., Debattista et al. 2008; Duffy et al.
2010). TNG50 implements a wide range of gravitational
and baryonic physical processes including stellar feed-
back, and reproduces several aspects of observed galax-
ies (Pillepich et al. 2019). Thus, following our demon-
stration of the diversity of tilted dark halos in TNG50,
we believe that real galactic halos must also exhibit such
diversity.
The origin of the warped disks in galaxies including
the Milky Way is a longstanding mystery (Kerr 1957;
Burke 1957). Bosma (1991) find that at least half of spi-
ral galaxies are warped, which suggests that the warping
mechanism must be universal and long-lasting. Semczuk
et al. (2020) have shown in TNG100 that 35% of the
warped disks are caused by satellite encounters (half of
which lead to a merger). These satellite-driven warps
are transient, surviving on average about 1 Gyr. In this
study, we have shown that a tilted dark halo can sustain
a long-lasting warp ( >4 Gyr), and that half of the Milky
Way analogs have tilt angles greater than 10◦. For the
Milky Way, Han et al. (in prep.) demonstrate the same
process in an idealized simulation. Using a tilted, triax-
ial dark halo component based on the observed stellar
halo—i.e., adopting a “minimal-tuning” model for the
dark halo—they calculate the orbits of disk particles.
Remarkably, the disk develops a stable warp within 1
Gyr at precisely the observed amplitude, direction, and
shape of the Galactic disk warp and flare (Grabelsky
et al. 1987; Bosma 1991; Levine et al. 2006). Thus, the
results from TNG50 and the isolated simulation make a
compelling case for tilted dark halos being the primary
driver of warped galaxies in the observed universe.
