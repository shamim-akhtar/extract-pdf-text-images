Figure 2. Relationship between the dark halo and the stel-
lar halo tilt angles. Each point shows the dark halo and
stellar halo tilt angle at one snapshot, spanning all of the ha-
los and lookback times from Fig 1. The pink shaded region
marks the measured Galactic stellar halo tilt from Han et al.
(2022a), and the blue histogram on the right panel shows
the marginal distribution of the Milky Way’s dark halo. The
blue horizontal line shows the most likely value of the Galac-
tic dark halo to be 20◦.
cles is 4 .5×105M⊙, and that of the stellar particles
is within a factor of 2 from the target baryonic mass
resolution of 8 .5×104M⊙. Combined with this reso-
lution and the cosmological volume, TNG50 captures a
wide range of galaxy formation processes from massive
galaxy clusters to isolated dwarf galaxies. At z= 0,
there are ∼900,000 halos and subhalos with gravita-
tionally bound mass greater than 108M⊙. Details of
the simulation can be found in Nelson et al. (2019a,b);
Pillepich et al. (2019).
Using TNG50, Pillepich et al. (2023) identify Milky
Way and M31-like galaxies in the simulation. For
this study, we use their “observable-based selection,”
which is the subset of three criteria: (1) 10 .5<
log10(M∗/M⊙)<2×1012, (2) no massive galaxy within
500 kpc and Mhost,200c<1013M⊙, and (3) disky galax-
ies (based on Pillepich et al. 2019, and visual inspection).
This selection yields 198 galaxies and their host halos.
For each halo, we define the “tilt angle” to be a
misalignment of the stellar disk and the inner dark
halo, and calculate this quantity using the following
method. We first select dark matter particles with
r∈(10 kpc ,50 kpc). From the position and mass of
each particle, we calculate the moment of inertia ten-
sor. By solving for the eigenvector-eigenvalue pairs of
the tensor, we find the three principal axes of rotation
and their respective moments of inertia. The major axishas the minimum moment of inertia, and the minor axis
has the maximum moment of inertia. The moments of
inertia Ii,i∈ {a, b, c}, can be related to the “length” ri
of the principal axes as the following:
Ii∝r2
j+r2
k→r2
i∝−Ii+Ij+Ik
2(1)
Using this relation, we can compute the major-to-
intermediate and major-to-minor axes ratios as follows:
1 :rb
ra:rc
ra= 1 :r
Ia−Ib+Ic
−Ia+Ib+Ic:r
Ia+Ib−Ic
−Ia+Ib+Ic

Some studies calculate the “reduced” moment of iner-
tia to down-weight the outer halo particles (e.g., Allgood
et al. 2006; Vera-Ciro et al. 2011; Schneider et al. 2012;
Emami et al. 2021). In this study, we are limiting the
analysis to particles with 10 kpc < r < 50 kpc, and do
not downweight the particles. The canonical moment of
inertia is sufficient to capture the misalignment of the
halo and the disk, and also allows for an easier inter-
pretation of the result. Furthermore, the tilt angle is
insensitive to the actual values of the moments of iner-
tia; it is only sensitive to the direction of the principal
axes.
Once we obtain the principal axes, we measure the
tilt angle as the angle between the minor axis and the
Z-axis, which is set by the total angular momentum of
the stellar disk. There are two motivations to use the
minor axis as opposed to the major axis. First, many
TNG50 galaxies show an oblate inner halo (see last row
of Fig. 1), meaning that the major and intermediate
axes are roughly degenerate with each other. This is
consistent with previous studies (e.g., Kazantzidis et al.
2004; Shao et al. 2021). In this scenario, the degener-
acy between the major/intermediate axes (and the cor-
responding freedom of azimuthal rotation) causes their
angle with respect to the Z-axis to be an unstable mea-
surement. On the other hand, the minor axis is almost
never degenerate, making its angle with the Z-axis a
much more stable measurement. Secondly, when the
minor axis is aligned with the Z-axis, the halo is sta-
ble against perturbations to the gravity of the disk, and
when the minor axis is 90◦to the Z-axis, the halo is un-
stable. This analogy yields an intuitive interpretation
of the tilt angle. We note that the stellar halo tends to
be more triaxial than the dark halo in TNG50, which
means that all three axes are nondegnerate and one can
use either the major or minor axis to measure the tilt
angle.
